# Shtokal's C# Playground

Welcome to `shtokal_csharp_playground`, a repository where I, Serhii Shtokal, explore the vast capabilities of C# and the .NET platform. This repository serves as a personal sandbox for experimenting with C# features, design patterns, algorithms, and more, using .NET 6 and newer versions.

## About the Repository

This playground is a collection of standalone projects and snippets that each demonstrate a specific concept or functionality within C#. From basic syntax to advanced topics, this repository is a reflection of my journey through .NET development.
